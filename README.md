# Rock, Paper, Scissors - A Simple JavaScript Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This is a simple project I created as part of my learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The game is played in the browser and uses JavaScript for the logic, with input from the player via prompts.

## How to Play

1. The game is played over five rounds.
2. Each round, you'll be prompted to choose either "rock", "paper", or "scissor".
3. The computer will randomly choose its option.
4. The scores will be updated after each round, and the final score will be displayed at the end of the five rounds.

## What I Learned

This project was a fantastic way to apply some of the JavaScript basics I’ve been learning. Here’s a brief summary of what I gained from this experience:

- **Functions**: I practiced writing functions that handle specific tasks, such as getting user input, generating the computer’s choice, and playing a round of the game.
- **Conditionals**: I deepened my understanding of using `if-else` statements and `switch` cases to control the game’s flow.
- **Recursion**: I learned how to use recursion to re-prompt the user in case of incorrect input.
- **Basic Game Logic**: I implemented simple game logic to determine the winner of each round and keep track of the scores.

## Challenges

As a beginner, I faced some challenges while working on this project:

- Ensuring that the user input was validated correctly.
- Structuring the game logic in a way that was easy to understand and debug.
- Handling edge cases, like what happens when the user enters an invalid choice.

Each challenge was a valuable learning opportunity, and I’m grateful for the experience.

## Next Steps

This project is just a small step in my learning journey. Moving forward, I plan to:

- Improve the user experience by adding a graphical interface.
- Refactor the code to make it more modular and maintainable.
- Explore additional JavaScript concepts such as event listeners and DOM manipulation.
